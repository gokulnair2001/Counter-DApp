# Counter
This repo is for beginners who want to have a hands-on with Dapp(Decentralised applications). Basically in this repo, I have deployed a Smart Contract on **Ethereum** chain. The contract performs a counter action where a variable gets increased by 1 with every transaction.  

# Technologies
1. [Remix Ethereum](https://remix.ethereum.org)

Remix IDE is an open source web and desktop application. It fosters a fast development cycle and has a rich set of plugins with intuitive GUIs. Remix is used for the entire journey of contract development as well as being a playground for learning and teaching Ethereum.

2. [Meta Mask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)

MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

3. [PolygonScan](https://polygonscan.com)

It connects Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks and is built to solve the scalability issues on the current Ethereum network.

# Languages
1. Solidity 
2. HTML
3. JavaScript
 
# Setup
## Meta Mask

So as explained Meta Mask is a wallet use to interact with Ethereum chain. For every transaction you do on the chain you need to give a fees called **Gas**. So in order to pay this Gas you need a wallet.

* First create a account on Meta Mask and add the extension on you browser.
* Then ini

## Smart Contract
1. Develop the smart contract

The rep consist of an file called [counter.sol]() which consist of the smart contract code. Use the Remix compiler to develop it. In order to develop it open the Remix IDE, in the **Contracts** section under **Artifacts** create a new file and add the code.

2. Deploy the code
